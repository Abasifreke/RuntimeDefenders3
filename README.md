NEWS
=================

- (Feb. 10 Mon) The new repo is up. We are no longer using version numbers in the java file names because it can lead to errors.
So now we need to be extra careful to let others know what file we're working on and to log what we've changed in the file.

Keeping the Repository Consistent
==

- Pull before pushing, making sure you have the most recent repository
- Let everyone know on Watsapp that you've uploaded something to the repo so everyone can pull it
- Let people know in the repo README what file you're working on so someone else doesn't accidentally work on it at the same time
- Use Eclipse to push files (not through the github site) and be sure to log changes

ACTIVITY
==
Let others know what files you're working on so no one else will work on it at the same time.
