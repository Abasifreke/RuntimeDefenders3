Keeping the Repository Consistent
==

- Pull before pushing, making sure you have the most recent repository
- Let everyone know on Watsapp that you've uploaded something to the repo so everyone can pull it
- Let people know in the repo README what file you're working on so someone else doesn't accidentally work on it at the same time
- Use Eclipse to push files (not through the github site) and be sure to log changes
